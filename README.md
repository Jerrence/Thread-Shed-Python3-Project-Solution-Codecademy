# Thread-Shed-Python3-Project-Solution-Codecademy
This took me 3 days of hard work I'm glad if this solution helps! 

## Running python code
You can run the code by saving the file then running the code by **dowloading the python command prompt** which can be found in microsoft store or the app store.
\n
Then run the command in the command prompt or terminal
**python3 file_name**
\n
(Replace file_name with the file's name e.g. script.py. Make sure you find the location of your file before you type this command in!)
